# ambientmixer - a graphical Python player with pygame to play and edit ambient-mixer.com mixes locally
This script is based on Philooz's script found here: https://github.com/Philooz/pyambientmixer
This little hacked script is here to allow people to download and play ambient mixes stored on ambient-mixer.com. It's not really "out for all users", but it works enough to be public.
